# Analysis of Córdoba's Intercity Transportation System

This repository contains code and analysis related to the intercity transportation system of the province of Córdoba, Argentina. The main goal is to explore and learn how to work with real-transport data, applying data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Data
The data used in this repository comes from Cordoba's ERSeP and Secretary of Transportation and includes information about routes, schedules, pasengers, frequencies, and other relevant aspects of the intercity transportation system.

## Technologies Used
I mostly use R language, but I'll try to re-write every code in Python.
